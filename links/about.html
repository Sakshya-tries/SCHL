        <h2 style="text-align: center;">S.C.H.L.: Senior Citizen Help-line</h2>
        <h3>Team Name: Tech Wizards</h3>
        We are a team of six second-year engineering students from KIPM College of Engineering and Technology,
        passionate
        about raising awareness and advocating for the cause of elder abuse. We created this website to provide a
        comprehensive resource for elders, their families, and caregivers, including information on what elder abuse is,
        how
        to identify it, and what to do if you suspect it is happening. <br><br>
        We were inspired to start this project after learning about the alarming prevalence of elder abuse. According to
        the
        National Council on Aging, one in ten older adults experiences some form of abuse each year. Elder abuse can
        take
        many forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, and financial abuse. It can also include neglect, which is
        the
        failure to provide an older adult with the basic necessities of life, such as food, water, shelter, and medical
        care. <br><br>
        Elder abuse is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for older adults. It can lead to
        physical
        and emotional harm, social isolation, and even death. We believe that everyone deserves to live their golden
        years
        in safety and dignity, and we are committed to doing our part to end elder abuse. <br><br>
        Through our website, we provide a variety of resources to help those affected by elder abuse. We have
        information on
        how to identify elder abuse, how to report it, and where to get help. We also offer support and resources for
        caregivers. <br><br>
        We are committed to raising awareness about elder abuse and to advocating for the rights of older adults. We
        believe
        that everyone has a responsibility to protect our elders, and we hope that our website will be a valuable
        resource
        for those affected by elder abuse. <br><br>

        <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
        Our mission is to end elder abuse through education, awareness, and advocacy. We believe that everyone has a
        right
        to live in safety and dignity, regardless of age.

        <h2>Our Vision:</h2>
        We envision a world where all older adults are safe, respected, and valued. We believe that everyone has a role
        to
        play in ending elder abuse, and we are committed to working together to create a better future for our elders.

        <h2>Our Team:</h2>
        We are a team of six second-year engineering students from KIPM College of Engineering and Technology, with a
        shared
        passion for ending elder abuse. Our team members are:
        <br>

        <h2>How to get involved?</h2>

        There are many ways to get involved in the fight against elder abuse. Here are a few ideas:

        * Learn more about elder abuse and how to identify it.
        * Talk to your friends and family about elder abuse.
        * Donate to or volunteer with a local organization that supports elders.
        * Report any suspected elder abuse to the authorities.

        Together, we can make a difference in the lives of older adults. <br><br>
